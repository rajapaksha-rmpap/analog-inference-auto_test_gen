AUTOMATIC TEST GENERATION 

The objective of the Automatic Test Generation is to create the sim and spec json files of the tests by using a small-size json file that contains only the main specifications, so that creating 
new tests does not require going through and changing lengthy parameter lists, thus the process become easier. 

This process also tries to identify and eleminate errors and contradicting values in the specification entries that can lead to the creation of sim and spec json files that represent unrealistic 
neural networks. 

How to run it 

How to use it/ how to create new tests using this method 
    What is the structure of input.json? 
    What are the main parameters you should specify for each layer type? 
    Then, what does it calculate and how? (the specific relations are to be stated.)
    And, for each of these params and param-categories, what are some auxillary info? err msgs, etc.
